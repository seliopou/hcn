20 July 1969&mdash;Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on a
celestial object, closely followed by Buzz Aldrin. The third crew-member manned
the command module. His name has been lost to history.

This was the first step on man&rsquo;s journey to colonize the cosmos. It also
marked the beginning of the US space program&rsquo;s steady decline and the
public's waning interest in space exploration. However, today&rsquo;s events
set the foundation for commercial space flight.

Upon hearing the news, everbody for the next forty years was quoted as saying,
&ldquo;The first manned mission to Mars is definitely going to happen in the
next 10 to 15 years.&rdquo;

The future of space travel remains speculative, so we will not speculate. Once
the future happens&mdash;space-reated or otherwise&mdash;our commentary will
follow within a half-century.
