20 July 1969&mdash;Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on a
celestial object, closely followed by Buzz Aldrin. The third crew-member manned
the command module. His name has been lost to history.

This was the first step on man&rsquo;s journey to colonize the cosmos. It also
marked the beginning of the US space program&rsquo;s steady decline and waning
public interest in space exploration. However, today&rsquo;s events set the
foundation for commercial space flight.

The future of space travel remains speculative, so we will not speculate. Once
it happens, our commentary will follow within a half-century.
